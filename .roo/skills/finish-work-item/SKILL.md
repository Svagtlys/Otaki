# Finish Work Item

## Overview

Verify tests pass, lint is clean, all plan tasks are accounted for in commits, and the branch is pushed and ready for review.

**This skill MUST run in code mode** (to execute verification and git commands). It is invoked after implementation completes (via subagent-driven-development or executing-plans).

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finish-work-item skill to prepare this work item for review."

## Prerequisites

- Implementation is complete (plan tasks all done)
- You are on the feature/fix/hotfix branch
- A draft PR exists (created by `start-work-item`)
- You are in **code mode**

## Step 1: Run Tests

```bash
backend/.venv/bin/pytest
```

**If tests fail:** Stop and inform the user. Do not proceed.

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before preparing for review:

[Show failures]
```

## Step 2: Run Linting

```bash
backend/.venv/bin/ruff check .
```

**If lint errors:** Fix them or run `backend/.venv/bin/ruff check . --fix` and commit the fix.

## Step 3: Verify Frontend Builds (if frontend changes exist)

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/develop...HEAD | grep -q '^frontend/'
```

If frontend files changed:

```bash
(cd frontend && npm run build)
```

**If build fails:** Stop and inform the user.

## Step 4: Load the Implementation Plan

Read the plan file to verify all tasks are accounted for:

```bash
# Find the plan file for this branch
ls docs/superpowers/plans/
```

Read the plan and extract the task list. Compare against commits to ensure every task has corresponding committed work.

## Step 5: Audit Commits Against the Plan

List current commits on the branch:

```bash
git log --oneline origin/develop..HEAD
```

Cross-reference each plan task with commits:

| Check | Action |
|---|---|
| Task has no commits | Ask user — was this task skipped or forgotten? |
| Uncommitted changes exist | Stage and commit with proper conventional commit message |
| Commits not in plan | Verify they are related (refinements, fixes) — if unrelated, ask user |

### Ensure Proper Commit Messages

Each commit must follow Conventional Commits per [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-conventions):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

**Type mapping from branch prefix:**

| Branch prefix | Commit type |
|---|---|
| `feature/*` | `feat` |
| `fix/*` | `fix` |
| `docs/*` | `docs` |
| `chore/*` | `chore` |
| `hotfix/*` | `fix` |

**Commit size:** One logical change per commit. If a commit message needs "and" to describe what changed, it should be split.

## Step 6: Stage Any Remaining Uncommitted Work

```bash
git status
```

If uncommitted changes exist, stage and commit them with proper conventional commit messages referencing the relevant plan task.

## Step 7: Push Final Branch State

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

If you rebased locally:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

## Step 8: Update Draft PR Description

Ensure the PR description references the plan and spec:

```markdown
Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>

## Description
[Brief description from the issue]

## Implementation
- [Task 1 summary]
- [Task 2 summary]

## References
- Design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Checklist
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Lint clean
- [x] Frontend builds (if applicable)
```

Update the PR body:

```bash
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --body-file pr-body.md --repo Svagtlys/Otaki
```

## Step 9: Mark PR Ready for Review

```bash
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --ready --repo Svagtlys/Otaki
```

GitHub automation will move the linked issue from **In Progress** to **In Review**.

## Step 10: Inform the User

```
Work item #<ISSUE_NUMBER> is ready for review.

Branch: <branch-name>
PR: https://github.com/Svagtlys/Otaki/pull/<PR_NUMBER>
Status: Ready for review (was draft)

Verification:
- Tests: <N>/<N> passing
- Lint: Clean
- Build: <Passing / Not applicable>

Commits:
- <commit 1: message>
- <commit 2: message>

Plan tasks accounted for: <X>/<X>
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Merging without running tests** — Always run `backend/.venv/bin/pytest` first.
- **Squashing commits in this skill** — Squashing is a merge-time decision. This skill ensures commits are clean but does not squash.
- **Wrong commit type** — Map branch prefix to conventional commit type correctly.
- **Skipping the venv prefix** — Always use `backend/.venv/bin/` for Python commands.
- **Creating a new PR** — The draft PR already exists from `start-work-item`. Edit it, don't create a new one.
- **Forgetting frontend build check** — If frontend files changed, verify `npm run build`.
- **Ignoring plan-task coverage** — Every plan task must have corresponding commits.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Merge without running tests
- Squash commits in this skill (squash happens at merge time)
- Force-push without `--force-with-lease`
- Skip conventional commit format

**Always:**
- Verify tests before touching merge
- Use `backend/.venv/bin/` prefix for Python commands
- Audit commits against the implementation plan
- Mark PR ready (don't merge directly without review unless explicitly told)
